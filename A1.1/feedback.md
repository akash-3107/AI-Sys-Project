-----------------

A few problems were missing, alongside a few instances of bad costs being computed (mainly in the arrival time category), and some non-optimal costs in price and arrival time. Otherwise everything looks good!  
My only comment would be towards the solution approach, which I find to be a bit short. I would have liked more elaboration on each of the points written alongside things like (for example): what worked well? what did you find challenging? and so on.
