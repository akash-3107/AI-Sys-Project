# Personal admin repository of Akash Tambe for AI1SysProj

*This document is automatically generated and occasionally updated – changes will get overwritten*

You can use this repository to submit files (reports, reviews, slides) and to get the reports that you have to review.
Furthermore, this file summarizes your status (solved assignments etc.).
If you notice any mistakes, please reach out!
You can optionally use it for working on the reports, reviews and slides.


## Submitting Files
To submit a file, simple put it into the root directory of the `main` branch.

**Important:** The filename should be *exactly* as specified (I use a script for sharing them to avoid making mistakes).
Also, once you have submitted a preliminary report/review, it may be shared with others.
Therefore, you should not put your name in them.
Furthermore, if you need more time, you should ask for it and not submit your current version.

Your filenames should be:
* `report-preliminary.pdf` for the preliminary report (anonymous!).
* `report-final.pdf` for the final report.
* `review1.txt` or `review1.pdf` for the first review written by you (anonymous!).
* `review2.txt` or `review2.pdf` for the second review written by you (anonymous!).
* `review3.txt` or `review3.pdf` for the second review written by you (anonymous!).

Furthermore, the following files will be placed in this repository:
* `report1.pdf` is the first report that you should write a review for.
* `report2.pdf` is the second report that you should write a review for.
* `report3.pdf` is the third report that you should write a review for.
* `review-of-your-report-*.txt` or `review-of-your-report-*.pdf` are reviews by other students of your report (usually 2).
